# Step 3 : Multiple input image -> 2 Classes

In this step, we will train a model to classify cervical images into two classes: `Positive` (0) and `Negative` (1).

The `Positive` class indicates the presence of disease (LSIL, HSIL, or Cancer), while the `Negative` class indicates the absence of disease (Normal).

The model takes an input composed of multiple images and outputs one of the two classes.
